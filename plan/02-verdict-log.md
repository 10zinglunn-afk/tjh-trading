# 02 — Verdict Log (the track record)

Home: [[PROJECT_PLAN]] · Owner: **Henry** (with Tenzing's harness output)

*This is the club's actual research record and our most valuable asset. One row per test.
Newest first. The point is honesty: most rows will say "no edge." That's the truth working.*

## How to read a row
- **OOS net** = out-of-sample walk-forward return, net of `costs.py`. The only number that matters.
- **vs SPY** = same-window buy-and-hold SPY return. If we didn't beat this, active trading lost.
- **Verdict** = KILL / ITERATE / ADVANCE (to paper) — never "trust me."

| Date | Strategy | Data (ticker / freq / window) | Cost regime | OOS net | vs SPY | Verdict | Notes |
|------|----------|-------------------------------|-------------|---------|--------|---------|-------|
| 2026-06-12 | Baselines (SMA, mean-rev, random) | 6 real tickers, daily, 2018–2026 | Liquid ETF 3/1 | — | — | KILL | None beat buy-and-hold OOS after costs (from project notes). |
| _pending_ | Kronos zero-shot | 6 real tickers, daily | Liquid ETF 3/1 | _run for real_ | | _pending_ | Expectation: fails on daily bars. Run locally, not --mock. |

## Standing expectations (so we're not surprised)
- Daily-bar strategies mostly die after costs. Kronos is strongest intraday.
- Options regime (300/50 bps) eats almost any active edge → expect ~−100% for naive options.
